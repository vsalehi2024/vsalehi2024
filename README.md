# Hi there 👋 I'm Vaji

🚀 Electrochemist by trade | 🔬 Water Electrolysis Specialist | 🤖 ML Explorer

I'm a materials scientist with 7+ years of hands-on experience in electrochemical systems, especially in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (AEMWE). I've tested and tortured membranes, coated MEAs, designed microbial electrolysis systems, and helped push advanced electrolyzers closer to commercialization.

Recently, I’ve been combining my in-deepth lab experience with code—leveraging Python, R, and SQL to analyze, optimize, and predict electrochemical performance. I’m currently pursuing a Machine Learning certificate and I love exploring data-driven insights.

💼 Most of my work is private due to NDA-heavy environments, but I'm always cooking up something exciting.
